stationary-vector
=================

1. Introduction
---------------

This program computes stationary vectors of large, sparse milestoning
matrices.

2. Dependencies
---------------

It is necessary that some version of ARPACK [1, 2] is available on
your system.  If you don't have this library, check Section 3.1 for
instructions on how to set it up.

3. Compilation
--------------

3.1. Quick instructions to compile LAPACK and ARPACK
----------------------------------------------------

Carry out the following steps only if your system does not already
have a recent version of ARPACK installed.

1. Download LAPACK from http://www.netlib.org/lapack/#_software

2. Configure and install LAPACK:  After unpacking the tarball, do:

mkdir build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME \
      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
make
make install

3. Download ARPACK from
https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng/releases.  After unpacking the
tarball, do:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$HOME/lib/pkgconfig
./configure --prefix=$HOME --with-lapack=$HOME/lib/liblapack.so \
           --with-blas=$HOME/lib/libblas.so
make
make install

3.2 Compiling the stationary-vector program
-------------------------------------------

Follow these steps:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make

4. Usage
--------

The program takes a matrix as input and produces an output file
containing the (suitably normalized) stationary vector.

Run it from the command line as follows:

./stationary-vector matrix-file-name output-file-name

5. Matrix file format
---------------------

The input matrix file is a text file that begins with a line
containing the dimension of the matrix.  The subsequent lines are of
the form: row-index whitespace column-index whitespace value.  Only
non-zero values will be read into memory.

For example, the following three lines would correspond to a 2 x 2
identity matrix:

2
1 1 1.0
2 2 1.0
