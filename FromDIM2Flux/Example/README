To run this example, first run program FromDIM2Kmatrix:

../FromDIM2Kmatrix.exe
(we asume that the executable is above the directory that contains the example data)

Then run stationary-vector to get the flux vector (q.dat in this example)
../build/stationary-vector Kij_nonzero_for_q.dat milestone_lifetime_for_q.dat q.dat
(assuming you build and compile that program in directory build as instructed in README file
