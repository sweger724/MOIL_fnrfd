Makefile templates of the form Makefilename.template are provided which contain entries for several
popular platforms and compilers.  To build MOIL, you must copy the templates to makefiles of the 
same name (omitting the .template extension) and comment in/out the appropriate FORTRAN compiler
for your platform.

The script ./copyTemplates will copy all templates to makefiles, which you may then edit.

The script ./make_all will prompt you and automatically execute ./copyTemplates if it cannot find a Makefile.

./make_all builds all of the command line MOIL programs.  To build MOIL, and in addition build any
components for visualization, you may use the make_distro_<platform> script in the moil/make_distribution
folder instead, which calls make_all among other things.
